Join us in London on 7-8 April for the 4th European PolMeth meeting!

PolMeth Europe brings together junior and senior scholars interested in innovative research methods and their applications. We welcome proposals that focus on methodological contributions as well as work that applies cutting-edge empirical methods to research questions from all subfields. We particularly encourage submissions from underepresented minorities. 

To apply, please submit your abstract (max. 250 words) by November 30th 2024 using the following form. All submissions will be considered for paper presentations. We also welcome submissions for poster presentations, which will be exhibited during lunch.

If you have any questions, please contact the local organizers at t.robinson7@lse.ac.uk and nelson.ruiz@essex.ac.uk.
